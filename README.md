### This repository contains a recommendation system for both item based and user based.

- each notebook can be transformed into a script that can be run separately

- the data folder contains data for item based and user based recommendations 

- in particular, for the item based recommendation system, the Jaccard distance is used to find similarity between items

- the user based system instead uses Euclidean distance and Pearson correlation to measure the distance between users and eventually recommend them other similar users or items they might like.
